# Single Investment Calculator

This project is created to calculate an estimated investment return by inputting some data for the investment.

This project is using MVC design pattern.

In order to execute the project, please run main.py

Feature that I will work on next: <br/>
* better UI design.
* use web scraper to get price history of the investment.
* use SQLite to store users input
* create data validations in the controller file.
* Instead of single window, maybe create a multi-layer window for user to input multiple investment all at one.

Photo demonstration will be provided once the project is completed.
